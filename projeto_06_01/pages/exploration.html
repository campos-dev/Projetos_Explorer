  <p>
    The celestial bodies and stars have always been a source of great
    fascination for mankind. There are records of Greeks, Mesopotamians, and
    Aztecs describing various celestial events. In the contemporary era, several
    scientists have made major contributions to making the dream of exploring
    space a reality, such as the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the German
    Hermann Oberth and the American Robert Goddard.
